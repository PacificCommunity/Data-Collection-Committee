**2.	Purpose**
This document serves to provide a set of operating procedures in handling and processing electronically reported observer data using the OLLO app. 

**3.	Scope and background**
This document covers electronic observer data management and handling with regards to observers working for national Observer Programme who are placed on either national and/or foreign flagged horizontal longline vessels. 
This document assumes all parties are familiar with the processes, systems, apps and other tools that are used in the handling and management of electronically reported observer data. 
It is anticipated that this is a living document, and the contents will be updated to reflect the changing and constantly modernising longline fisheries monitoring operations.

**4.	Data collection and timing**
The aim of electronic observer data collection is to collect monitoring information on fishing activities conducted by horizontal longline fishing vessels operating in Exclusive Economic Zones of Pacific Islands Countries and Territories
as well as on the Areas Beyond National jurisdictions in some cases. This information is used for scientific purposes, national and regional reporting, and MCS and licensing activities. 
The procedures and responsible staff must be clearly identified in order to ensure that data collection activities are well understood and properly resourced.

**4.1 Observer data collection in Solomon Islands**
Presently, a key  Tuna fishery in the WCPFC involves surface horizontal longline fishing vessels specifically targeting tuna and tuna-like species, operating within Pacific Islands’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) 
extending up to 200 nautical miles from a country's coastline. While most fishing activity occurs within EEZs, foreign-flagged vessels can access the high seas adjacent with a permit from their respective flag states and the WCPFC. 
The National Observer Programes (NOPs) maintain close collaboration with the Oceanic Fisheries Program (OFP) of the Secretariat of the Pacific Communities (SPC) to collect data on the status of tuna resources in Member countries.
Most PICTs use the web-based regional database system TUFMAN-2 developed and maintained by SPC on behalf of its Member countries. Overall, the implementation of TUFMAN-2 and its associated ER applications 
has significantly enhanced data collection and reporting capabilities in Solomon Islands’ fisheries sector. The use of these tools has improved the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of data, 
supporting evidence-based decision making and contributing to the sustainable management of fisheries resources. 

With regards to the **Offline LongLine Observer (OLLO)** data collection application, it was first trialed in 2020. 

In 2023, SPC developed an e-debriefing module in TUFMAN2. In September 2024, the first sub-regional national training for observer e-reporting and e-debriefing was conducted.

**5.	OLLO operations** 
**5.1 Training for operating OLLO**

Training observers on how to operate OLLO can be conducted either online or face to face. While experienced observers were initially trained, gradual introduction to OLLO to less experienced observers and newly recruited observers 
is being considered. 

At this stage, considering the gradual development of OLLO to respond to observer programmes’ needs, there is no user manual for OLLO, nor are the instructions for how observer operations should be conducted included in OLLO. 
For detailed instructions on how observer data should be collected, OLLO users are required to follow the instructions on the back of the forms in the SPC/FFA REGIONAL LONGLINE FISHERIES OBSERVER WORKBOOK 
(https://www.pirfo.org/index.php/resources/downloads/category/32-longline). 
In addition, the SPC Longline Observer Guide provides clear instructions on regional standardised observer operations. (https://www.spc.int/resource-centre/publications/longline-observer-guide-2021)

A video tutorial demonstrating how to record observer data using OLLO is however available: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZhvTh1GJ9qO7od9TtE15VBmuNwYCoOHu/view?usp=sharing) 
Each NOP is responsible for managing the training of observers to use OLLO. This includes initial and refresher training. SPC is available to provide training and support to NOPs upon request. 

**5.2 Android tablet management**

Using OLLO requires the use of Android tablets to operate. This section of the document outlines the recommended practices for the management and care of these devices in order for OLLO to run efficiently. 
While OLLO can technically operate on Android smart phones, it is NOT recommended that OLLO be used on smaller smart phone’s screens, neither for demonstrating nor routine use.

The current (2025) recommended Android tablets for operating OLLO are the Samsung Galaxy Active Tab 5.
A tablet management plan is available to ensure efficient use of tablets. 

**5.3 Preparing for a trip using OLLO**
It is important to ensure these steps are followed before starting a trip using OLLO: 
- Check that Android software is up to date (https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en), and OLLO are updated 
- Check that the correct charging adaptor and cable are available 
- IMPORTANT: Check that a paper workbook and LL-4 forms are ALWAYS carried by the observer (either as a backup for experienced OLLO user, 
or as a tool for recording data by the observer conducting an initial trial of OLLO – double entry is necessary at first). 

**5.4 Launching OLLO**
1. Before launching the OLLO application, ensure GPS is turned on to facilitate accurate geolocation data capture.  
2. Download OLLO from the playstore (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spc.ofp.ollo&hl=en)
3. Open the Google Playstore, search for Chrome and make sure it is up to date.(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en)
4. Locate and tap the OLLO application icon on the tablet's home screen. 
5. In OLLO, go to the settings menu, on the right of the ENVIRONMENT field, check that the version number is the latest version (as of 31/03/25) latest version number is V 3.38.0). 
Should OLLO not be in its latest version, please update OLLO through the Google Playstore: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spc.ofp.ollo&hl=en_AU)

**5.5 Using OLLO at sea**
For detailed instructions on how observer data should be collected, OLLO users are required to follow the instructions on the back of the forms in the SPC/FFA REGIONAL LONGLINE FISHERIES OBSERVER WORKBOOK. 
In addition, the SPC Longline Observer Guide provides clear instructions on regional standardised observer operations. 
A video tutorial demonstrating how to record observer data using OLLO is however available: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZhvTh1GJ9qO7od9TtE15VBmuNwYCoOHu/view?usp=sharing)

It is highly recommended that observer check their data for accuracy and completeness DAILY. This ensures that any potential errors can be retrieved as close as possible after the actual event. 
The observer should take care when using OLLO on the work deck of a vessel. If the environmental conditions are too rough for securely operating a tablet on deck, 
the observer should use the waterproof paper LL-4 forms and transcribe the data to OLLO when possible. This should however not be a common practice as this double data entry can potentially lead to data entry errors. 
The observer can explain to the vessel crew that using OLLO is part of their duties and that the tablet they are using is a professional tablet. 

**5.6 Closing an OLLO trip and uploading to TUFMAN2 and engaging the e-debriefing process.**

When the observer returns to port, depending on the length of the trip, procedures for uploading OLLO data to TUFMAN2 need to be agreed and established and followed. 
Depending on the ICT skills and knoweledge of Tufman2 of the observer, two processes are available for observers. 

**First option:** Observer has good ICT skills and has been trained on Tufman2
Upon return to port, the observer closes the OLLO trip and uploads it to Tufman2. The observer can the edit the trip in Tufman2 before e-debriefing. This is a similar process to the observer returning to port and correcting their data in the paper workbook before undergoing debriefing.  
Once the observer is ready to be e-debriefed, they change the trip's status to 'ready for debriefing' in Tufman2. 

**Second option:** Observer still has limited ICT skills and has NOT (yet) been trained on Tufman2
Upon return to port, the observer uploads the OLLO trip to Tufman2. This secures the observer's data. The observer can then still edit the trip in OLLO before e-debriefing. This is a similar process to the observer returning to port and correcting their data in the paper workbook before undergoing debriefing. 
Once the observer is ready to be e-debriefed they will  need to close the OLLO trip and upload it to Tufman2. A tufman2 administrator in the NOP or at SPC will then be able to change the trip's status to 'ready for debriefing' in Tufman2.   

With OLLO potentially gradually becoming the primary data recording tool for longline observer data collection in NOPs, it may be useful to consider revising submission timelines associated with paper workbook data recording. 
The current timeline for paper workbook submission is 14 days. It is suggested that this be brought down to 10 days for OLLO. 
Using OLLO is an opportunity to trial the proposed Trip Summary presented during the 25th ROCW. This trial will be a collaboration between SBOB, FFA and SPC. 

Considering the commitment by Members for 100% use of ER (for catch and effort logsheet data) and that observer data is also e-reported it would be useful for both types of data to be submitted on the same timelines or close to each other, 
this allows the opportunity to conduct verification and validation of elog data potentially before the vessel departs for the next trip, and thus allowing time for providing feedback to the vessel operator in case elog data is incorrect or incomplete. 
The table below presents the key tasks observers and debriefers can undertake to ensure that e-reported observer data is efficiently managed. 

**Process for observer data reported using OLLO** 
| Task | When | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| Observer records observer forms in the OLLO app according to observer guidelines | During trip | Observer |
| Observer data are submitted from OLLO to TUFMAN2 | Max 10 days after arrival in port | Observer |
| Pre-debriefing conducted | Same day as arrival in port | Observer and debriefer |
| Debriefing date and time arranged and assigned | Once all data has been entered (Max 10 days after arrival in port) | Observer, debriefer and/or coordinator |
| The data are electronically debriefed according to PIRFO debriefing standards and these SOPs. | Once the trip is marked ‘ready to be debriefed’ | Debriefer and Observer — *Currently TUFMAN2 is set up so that only observers can mark the trip ‘ready for debriefing’. But SBOB have indicated that both observers and debriefers should be able to do this. SPC will provide feedback on when this is possible.* |
| Trip is marked as completed and debriefed | After e-debriefing is completed | Debriefer |
| Data are checked in TUFMAN2 and errors resolved, trip is closed when error-free | After debriefing is completed | Debriefer, observer coordinator and observer data entry staff |
|Trip is marked as completed and debriefed | After e-debriefing is completed |	Debriefer |
|Data are checked in TUFMAN2 and errors resolved, trip is closed when error-free |	After debriefing is completed	| Debriefer, observer coordinator and observer data entry staff. |
 
**6.	Observer debriefing operations**

The importance of debriefing is that observers work on board the vessel in situ, but remotely and without direct supervision.  Debriefing by a qualified expert at the end of an observer’s trip is the principal 
quality assurance process to ensure that the data are complete, are collected following established protocols and are accurate. 
This utilises the written (or electronic) record of the observer, his memory and the skill of the debriefer to verify events recorded. 
PIRFO Observers collect operational and catch data on purse seine, long line and pole and line fishing vessels that target tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. 
These data are used for the purposes of stock assessment, compliance monitoring and to assess the effectiveness of fisheries management initiatives. 
As such, it is critical that the data are accurate and that its accuracy can be guaranteed to third party users. To ensure consistency of the data collection; data collection protocols, 
the recording formats and training have become standardised across all PIRFO programmes of SPC/FFA Members. 
The role of a PIRFO Debriefer is to provide an independent assessment that the observer’s data are true, accurate and were collected according to established protocols.
PIRFO Observer Programme Managers and Coordinators are responsible to ensure that data collected by their observers accomplishes the goals of their programme and is consistent with national, 
sub regional and regional (WCPFC) obligations and minimum data standards. A consistent routine of debriefing observers will facilitate meeting this responsibility.
Debriefers guides can be found on the PIRFO website: (https://pirfo.org/index.php/resources/downloads/category/43-debriefer-guides)
This SOP does not address how debriefing should be conducted. This SOP describes how to use the e-debriefing tool in TUFMAN2. 

**6.1 Access to TUFMAN2 for observers and debriefers** 

The TUFMAN2 system is developed and maintained by the Data Management (DM) section of the OFP at SPC. SPC staff are responsible for providing training and level 1 support to NOPs. (https://www.spc.int/ofp/tufman2/data/ObserverTrip) 
Debriefers can view and edit all observer data. 
At the time of writting this SOP, different NOPs have expressed different needs for observers to access their data in Tufman2. 
This is an example from one NOP: 
-	An observer can ONLY view and edit their own data
-	An observer CANNOT view and edit other observer data
As of time of drafting this SOP, the TUFMAN2 business rules allows all observers (who have been provided a Tufman2 account) to view observer data from all observers in their respective NOP. An observer can however only edit their own observer data. SPC will need to change this business rule to respond to the need mentioned above and advise Tonga MoF about the timeline when this can be implemented. 
Tufman2 is currentlty undergoing a user roles development and should allow greater flexibility for accomodating business rules to suit different needs for different NOPs. Until this development is implemented, observers should refrain 
from viewing data from other observers as a matter of data integrity, security and respect. 
NOPs are responsible for requesting further training and support from SPC with regards to TUFMAN2 usage. 

**6.2 Using and developing the E-debriefing module**

The e-debriefing module is to be used when observer data is uploaded directly from OLLO to Tufman2.
Training materials and support mechanisms for observers using the e-debriefing module in T2 are gradually being developed, including this initial draft SOP. 
Feedback from NOPs to SPC is essential to allow the continual development and improvement of this new e-debriefing tool. NOps are responsible for providing feedback and recommendations to SPC. 

**6.3 E-debriefing process**
**6.3.1 Preparing a trip for e-debriefing**

Upon trip completion, the observer connects to the internet (via 4G or Wi-Fi), either uploads the OLLO trip TUFMAN2 or closes and uploads the trip to Tufman2 (see 5.6 above). 
When a trip is closed and upload to Tufman2, observers can then access TUFMAN2 to view and edit their data, Data Quality Checks (DQCs) are displayed at this stage. 

IMPORTANT: When any changes are made to the observer’s data (including changing the trip status), the user MUST press the green SAVE button on the top left corner of the page. 

**6.3.2 Creating an E-debriefing**
The debriefer must be logged in with his TUFMAN2 account. The debriefer clicks the "Start e-debriefing of trip" button under the Actions box on the right-hand side of the screen. 
This opens a new debriefing tab in the web browser. Currently, this action DE-ACTIVATES the DQCs (if there are any). However some NOPs have expressed the need for DQCs to remain displayed at all times, citing that 
DQCs are valuable tools that support quality assurance (provided debriefers are properly trained) and that de-activating them mid-process risks confusion and undermining consistency.

The integration of Data Quality Checks (DQCs) into the e-debriefing module supports continued training and mentoring of debriefers by providing real-time visibility of potential data issues without replacing human judgment. 
Displaying DQCs during e-debriefing encourages a consistent, high-quality review process, reinforces the importance of observer data accuracy, and enhances learning opportunities for both observers and debriefers. 
When combined with established debriefing protocols and ongoing training, DQCs become a valuable tool for strengthening data quality assurance, supporting observer performance feedback
and building a culture of continuous improvement across NOPs.

The observer’s data remains open in the original tab. It is recommended to display each tab on separate windows on separate screens for easy viewing. If only one screen is available, the debriefer can re-size each window so they both fit side by side on the same screen. 
As the debriefer provides answers to the debriefing questions, the relevant data field is automatically highlighted in the e-debriefing window. 

There are two way a debriefer can provide an answer a question: 

1.	The debriefer presses on the answer field and on the downward pointing arrow which displays a drop-down menu with the abbreviations of the possible answers. 
The debriefer selects the appropriate answer. For example, "Correct and Complete" is recorded as Cc. The following questions are answered in the same manner. 

2.	The debriefer presses on the answer field and enters the first letter of the abbreviation by pressing the letter on the keyboard. For example, to record an answer "Correct and Complete", the debriefer presses the C letter on the keyboard. 
To answer the following questions, the debriefer presses the TAB key on the left of the keyboard. 

Once a question is answered, depending on the answer, the question will be scored accordingly. For example a question answered Complete and correct will score 5/5. 

For each section, the debriefer can provide detailed comments aimed to provide feedback to the observer and observer coordinator.  The debrief must press the View/Enter blue button to the right of the last question of the section.

**IMPORTANT**: It is recommended that the debriefer presses the green SAVE button on the top right hand corner of the screen on a regular basis during the e-debriefing. 
This can be done after the last question of each section is answered. For sections with numerous questions, the debriefer should not wait until the last question to press the SAVE button but instead press the SAVE button more frequently. 

The length of time to undertake a complete debriefing depends mainly on the number of sets the observer has monitored during a trip. 
A trip with 60 sets monitored will take longer to debrief than a trip with 10 sets monitored. 
It also depends on the experience of the observer and the quality of the observer’s data. A debriefing can be conducted over more than one day. 

In case an e-debriefing is conducted over several sessions, the debriefer must press the blue Save & Exit button. 

To resume an e-debriefing session, the debriefer must go to the observer tab in TUFMAN2 and press on Debriefing. 
This will open the page displaying the debriefings. The debriefer then presses the blue Edit button to the right of the debriefing line. 
This action re-opens the e-debriefing and answering questions can resume.  


**6.3.4 Completing the E-debriefing**
All debriefing question must be answered to complete the e-debriefing. If no answers are recorded for one or more questions, the error ‘No answers scored’ will be displayed on the right of the screen. 

Once all debriefing questions have been answered, the debriefer must press the green SAVE button. 
This will turn the e-debriefing ‘Thumbs up’. This will allow to display the yellow ‘Close debriefing’ button under the action tab. The debriefer presses on this button to close the debriefing.  
Pressing the ‘Close debriefing’ button will display the following warning message: 'Are you sure you want to close this debriefing?' After closing it, it will not be editable by the debriefer. 
The debriefer must press the OK button in the window message to close the debriefing. 

Once the e-debriefing is closed, a score summary tab is available for the debriefer and the observer to view. 

SPC is still developing a feature which will enable sharing the debriefing summary and scores to the relevant personnel. 
Feedback is needed from NOPs to SPC regarding who will receive this information (for example the score summary could be sent to the observer coordinator, debriefer and observer, while the debriefing summary
could be sent to the observer coordinator and the observer). 

**6.4 Debriefer protocols for maintaining data quality**
While the e-debriefing module in Tufman2 can significantly improve the timeliness and efficiency of the debriefing process, it is not a replacement for established debriefing standards. 
The module simply changes the medium through which debriefings are conducted, not the protocols themselves. It remains essential that debriefers continue to follow the core standards
such as PIRDEB4.03C (Complete a debriefing process with a fisheries observer) and PIRDEB4.02C (Apply knowledge of application of obtained data and information), 
ensuring a thorough and methodical review of all observer data. 
The use of digital tools, including DQCs, should support and enhance—not substitute—the critical human expertise and judgement that are central to high-quality debriefing.
Debriefers must maintain PIRFO debriefer standard protocols, including but not limited to: 
●	Debriefers must critically review all data for inconsistencies or missing information.
●	Ask clarifying questions: Engage the observer in a dialogue to verify data accuracy and address any uncertainties.
●	Utilize comments section: Document justifications for data corrections or clarifications during the debriefing process.
●	Random data checks: Conduct spot checks on data beyond flagged DQC issues to ensure overall data integrity.
●	Adherence to PIRFO protocols: The e-debriefing module complements existing debriefing protocols outlined in PIRDEB4.03C (complete debriefing) and PIRDEB4.02C (data application knowledge). https://pirfo.org/index.php/resources/standards
●	Debriefer training: Training will emphasize the importance of thorough data review and maintaining established debriefing protocols.
●	Quality assurance: Regular audits or mentoring of debriefing sessions should be conducted to ensure adherence to protocols and data quality standards. The advantage of conducting a debriefing using the e-debriefing tool is that this can be shared and/or recorded (screen and audio) using Zoom for example. 

**6.4.1 Mitigating potential disadvantages of displaying DQCs**
While displaying DQCs has benefits, it also has potential disadvantages which need to be mitigated for. 
These include, but not limited to: 
●	Training: Debriefers will be trained on the proper use and interpretation of DQCs, emphasizing their role as complementary tools. This is a shared responsibility between the Data Management and Fisheries Monitoring sections at SPC and SBOB. 
●	Quality assurance: Regular audits and mentoring of debriefers must be conducted by the observer coordinator and the debriefer assessors to ensure thorough data review is conducted beyond using the DQCs.
●	DQC Updates: DQCs must be continuously updated to maintain relevance and effectiveness. This is the responsibility of the Data Management section at SPC from feedback from the SBOB and the Fisheries Monitoring section at SPC. 
●	Comprehensive debriefing: Debriefers will be encouraged to critically analyse all data, not just relying only on DQCs to debrief the observer’s data. 
●	Engagement and accountability: A culture of active engagement and data quality ownership must be fostered among debriefers and observers.
